The remaining items (or their value) needs to bedispersed among ourselves as heirs.<!--  OR left to be sold with the house. --><p>This site shows an inventory of items with photos & descriptions.<p>Our goal is to distribute as many items as possible for free amongourselves &mdash; as would be the wish of Grandmom and Poppy.<h2>PROCEDURE</h2><ol>	<li>		Please review this <a href="https://kensterr.github.io">House Contents Inventory</a>.  		A search bar is at top. Clicking a photo opens a new browser window with an enlarged photo.  	</li>	<br>	<li>		Items identified as <em>*Sells with House</em> are not available for distribution to heirs herein.  		(But heirs will receive their value eventually &mdash; as inherent to the increased house value  		"For Sale" package).  	</li>	<br>	<li>  		<a href="mailto:mcurione@gmail.com"> Send me an eMail</a> with the items you wish to possess.  		Please include the item name & number.  	</li>	<br>	<li>  		I will post a list showing items chosen & by whom.  	</li>	<br>	<li>		<strong>Items not chosen by any heir</strong> &mdash; will either be sold with the house or to a "collectibles"  		merchant for cash value that then pours back into the estate for equal division among the 8 heirs.  	</li>	<br>	<li>		<strong>Items chosen by only one heir</strong> &mdash; will be granted & given free to that heir.  	</li>	<br>	<li>  		<strong>Items chosen by multiple heirs</strong> &mdash; will have two solutions:		<ol type="a">		<br>		<li>		<strong>SWAP</strong> &mdash; Heirs can reconsider their own choices & negotiate informally with each other		about changing preferences & swap to accommodate each other.		</li>		<br>		<li>		<strong>AUCTION</strong> &mdash; Multiple heirs wishing a specific item can choose to bid for it in an auction,		coordinated by me. Highest bidder (after any counter-bidding rounds) "wins" the item		& writes a check to pay for it &mdash; the proceeds of which will be equally divided among		all heirs at estate settlement. Thus, the auction benefits all heirs.</li>		</ol>  	</li>	<br>	<li>		Some heirs may wish none or only a few household items, while other heirs may wish quite a few.  		Fair distribution does not mean that we each receive the exact number of items but that we are  		happy for other heirs to have items that we do not wish ourselves.  		Fairness is what we collectively agree for it to be &mdash; not confined merely to mathematical  		equivalency.  	</li>	<br>	<li>		Kenster will mail smaller items to you at <em>his expense</em>.  		Larger items would need to be picked up from the house.  	</li></ol></body></html>
