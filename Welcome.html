Clicking a photo opens a new browser window with an  		enlarged photo.  	</li>	<br>	<li>		Items identified as <em>*Sells with House</em> are not available for distribution		to beneficiaries herein. (But beneficiaries will receive their value eventually &mdash; as		inherent to the increased house value "For Sale" package.)  	</li>	<br>	<li>  		<a href="mailto:mcurione@gmail.com"> Send me an eMail</a> with the items you wish  		to possess. Please include the item name &amp; number.  	</li>	<br>	<li>  		I will post a list showing items chosen &amp; by whom.  	</li>	<br>	<li>		<strong>Items not chosen by any beneficiary</strong> &mdash; will either be sold with the		house or sold to a "collectibles" merchant for cash value that then pours back		into the estate for equal division among the 8 beneficiaries.  	</li>	<br>	<li>		<strong>Items chosen by only one beneficiary</strong> &mdash; will be granted &amp; given		to that beneficiary <strong>free</strong> &mdash; as would be the wish of Grandmom and Poppy.  	</li>	<br>	<li>  		<strong>Items chosen by multiple beneficiaries</strong> &mdash; will have two solutions:		<ol type="a">		<br>		<li>		<strong>SWAP</strong> &mdash; Beneficiaries can reconsider their own choices &amp; negotiate		informally with each other about changing preferences &amp; swap to accommodate each		other.		</li>		<br>		<li>		<strong>AUCTION</strong> &mdash; Multiple beneficiaries wishing a specific item can choose		to bid for it in an auction, coordinated by me. Highest bidder (after any		counter-bidding rounds) "wins" the item &amp; writes a check to pay for it &mdash;		the proceeds of which will be equally divided among all beneficiaries.		Thus, the auction benefits all beneficiaries.</li>		</ol>  	</li>	<br>	<li>		Some beneficiaries may wish none or only a few household items, while other beneficiaries may wish		quite a few. Fair distribution does not mean that we each receive the exact number		of items but that we are happy for other beneficiaries to have items that we do not wish		ourselves. Fairness is what we collectively agree for it to be &mdash; not		confined merely to mathematical equivalency.  	</li>	<br>	<li>		Kenster will mail smaller items to you at <em>his expense</em>.  		Larger items would need to be picked up from the house.  	</li></ol></body></html>
