Clicking a photo opens a new browser window with an	enlarged photo.		<ul>			<br><li>			Items identified as <strong>*Sells with House</strong> are not available for			distribution to beneficiaries herein &mdash; Beneficiaries will receive their			value through the increased value of the house "For Sale" package.			</li>		</ul>  	</li>	<br><li>  		<a href="mailto:mcurione@gmail.com"> Send me an eMail</a> with the items you wish  		to possess. Please include the item name &amp; number.	<ul>		<br><li>		<strong>DEADLINE for CONTENTS CHOICES is: Saturday FEB 17, 2024 at 11:59PM</strong>		<br>This concentrated time frame helps to expedite the next phases of the house		selling process: appraisal, price setting, etc. My goal is to sell the house		as soon as possible to reduce its exposure to the next Florida hurricane season.		</li>	</ul>  	</li>	<br><li>  		Once I hear from everyone regarding which, if any, items you wish to possess,  		I will update the  		<a href="https://kensterr.github.io/Inventory.html">House Contents Inventory</a>  		showing who would like to have which items.  	</li>	<br><li>		<strong>Items not chosen by any beneficiary</strong> &mdash; will either be sold		with the house <strong>OR</strong> sold to a "collectibles" merchant for cash		that then pours back into the estate for equal division among the 8 beneficiaries.  	</li>	<br><li>		<strong>Items chosen by only one beneficiary</strong> &mdash; will be granted		&amp; given to that beneficiary <strong>free</strong> &mdash; as would be the wish		of Grandmom and Poppy.  	</li>	<br><li>  		<strong>Items chosen by multiple beneficiaries</strong> &mdash; Each beneficiary  		wanting the item will submit a sealed 'bid' (to me) for the item as follows:		<ul>			<br><li>			<strong>PLACE a ONE-TIME OFFER</strong> &mdash; Multiple beneficiaries wishing			a specific item can choose to 'bid' for the item with a ONE-TIME PRICE OFFER.			Highest PRICE OFFER 'wins' the item. Once all sealed bids are in, I will			reveal the highest bidder. The 'winning' beneficiary will then write a check			to pay for the item &mdash; the proceeds of which will be equally divided			among all beneficiaries. Thus, this process benefits all of us.		</ul>  	</li>	<br><li>		Some beneficiaries may wish none or only a few household items, while other		beneficiaries may wish quite a few. Fair distribution does not mean that we each		receive the exact number of items but that we are happy for other beneficiaries		to have items that we do not wish ourselves. Fairness is what we collectively		agree for it to be &mdash; not confined merely to mathematical equivalency.  	</li>	<br><li>		Kenster will mail smaller items to you at <em>his expense</em>.  		Larger items would need to be picked up from the house.  	</li></ol></body></html>
